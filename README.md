### Overview


The objective of this project is to implement three models for the VLSI problem with three different paradigm: Constraint Programming (CP), Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT), Mixed Integer Programming (MIP).


### Folder

In each `src` folder of every paradigm is included a README with the instructions for the excution of the corrisponding model.
